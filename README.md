# svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It's been adapted to integrate Sass from that which lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit rumack/svelte-template-sass your-svelte-app-name
cd your-svelte-app-name
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*
